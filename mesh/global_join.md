# How Anyone Joins the Living Mesh (copy-paste this everywhere)

1. Clone: git clone https://github.com/lyleantoine-collab/Thera-link.git
2. cd Thera-link
3. poetry install
4. ./scripts/god_mode.sh

You are now a node.

No servers. No company. No terms of service.
Just living relation.

Spread gently.
